# pym
PYM is the acronym for Python Messaging. It is a messaging system written in Python language under the most permissive open source license, the MIT license, so that it can be extended and enriched by the software developers community.

I like the Python language. It is a language that is easy to learn, powerful, elegant and adapts to many contexts (infrastructure-as-code, data science, web app, backend, etc.). 

With my experience as a technical and software architect, my devops experience and my already long career, I decided to write PYM, a new general public messaging system which offers many properties: 

1. Easy to read software code and using a well-known language accessible to a large community of developers
2. Total transparency as code is fully auditable (WYSIWYG, the code is public in this repository)
3. Fast to install, you have only to download it from github and run it directly
4. Easy to install and use (including on a simple Windows Family laptop at home behind a firewall, no need for a server)
5. Extensible to allow the community to add new modules and new functionalities
6. Robust and scalable (resistant to any form of censorship, networking of servers via a discovery system)
7. Efficient and secure (data encryption at rest, in transit, in memory, protection of personal identity)
8. Your data exchanges, your messages, video and voice communications are not interceptable
9. Your data is not commercially exploited

And above all ... completely free!
